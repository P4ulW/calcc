# Basic AST eval calculator in C.
## Supports:
- Basic binary operators: +, -, *, /, ^
- Unary operators: +, -
- Operator precedence
- Parentheses

## Maybe I will add:
- support to exponent numbers, e.g. 1.3e9
- constants (pi, e, etc.)
- functions (log, exp, sqrt, etc.)
- robust error handling (as if)

---
## Motivation
I wanted to play around with a basic arena allocator and simple data structures in C. This turned out to be 
quite fun, honestly. Tough the AST building was rather tough to do.
